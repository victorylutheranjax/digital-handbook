      Video Editor</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This guide assumes you have the DaVinci Resolve video editor
      from BlackMagicDesign. It can be downloaded for free <a
        href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve" target="_blank"
        class="inline bg-gray-200 text-gray-700 font-medium text-sm px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-300 transition">here</a>.
      However, this software may be too advanced for
      some users, and, generally speaking, any video editor will do. Many of the concepts from this guide will
      apply to most video editors.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This guide will not go over how to install or run DaVinci
      Resolve. You can find instructions for that on BMD's support page <a
        href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/support/family/davinci-resolve-and-fusion" target="_blank"
        class="inline bg-gray-200 text-gray-700 font-medium text-sm px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-300 transition">here</a>.

      File Structure</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">File structure is important in DaVinci Resolve and most other
      video editors. It's good practice to keep all media relevant to your project in one master folder, with
      subfolders as desired. This guide will often make reference of the "root media folder", which is the master
      file that contains all your project media.</p>

        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">On the "Projects" screen, make sure the "Local" tab is selected.
          Click "New Project" in the lower right.</li>

            <p class="text-yellow-800 inline">You can change where your project is saved, but it is generally not
              recommended unless there is a good reason to do so.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Once the project has been created, ensure you are on the "Cut"
          tab,
          found in the bottom middle of the screen. Ensure also that the "Media Pool" is selected in the upper
          left
          corner of the screen.</li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Click the "Import Media Folder" icon in the upper left of the

        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Once DaVinci has finished importing the root media folder, the
          "Media Pool" area should populate with the subfolders in the root media folder.

            <p class="text-yellow-800 inline">You can see where you are in the file structure of your project by
              looking at the breadcrumbs above the "Media Pool". You can also navigate by clicking one of the

      </h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Our boilerplate project will include intro and end cards, as
        well as music to bookend the sermon. It is up to the user to supply graphics and audio for these purposes.
      </p>
      <div class="indent-0 mb-2 bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 rounded"><strong
          class="text-yellow-800 font-semibold inline">Note:&nbsp;</strong>
        <p class="text-yellow-800 inline">A boilerplate is not required to make one of these videos, but it will
          make repeated processes like these sermon videos much faster to set up and edit in the future.
          Additionally, you may choose to use different parts of the boilerplate (e.g., no music). The editing
          process will be largely the same, though some future steps in this guide may be different if all the
          boilerplate parts are not present.</p>
      </div>
      <ol class="space-y-3 list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">On the "Cut" tab, in the Media Pool, find the intro card in the
          file system.</li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Drag the graphic onto the timeline below the file system.
          <div class="indent-0 mb-2 bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 rounded"><strong
              class="text-yellow-800 font-semibold inline">Note:&nbsp;</strong>
            <p class="text-yellow-800 inline">You can drag the clip onto the timeline itself or the timeline
              overview band in the middle of the editor.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">To change the length of the graphic either click and drag the
          right (or left) edge of the clip or right click on the clip and click "Change clip duration...".

              class="text-green-800 font-semibold inline">Tip:&nbsp;</strong>
            <p class="text-green-800 inline">Five seconds is generally a good clip duration for intro and end
              cards.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the end card, leaving a little space
          between the intro and end card clips on the timeline.</li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the intro and outro music. Drop the
          music below the graphics clips on the timeline.
          <div class="indent-0 mb-2 bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 rounded"><strong
              class="text-yellow-800 font-semibold inline">Note:&nbsp;</strong>
            <p class="text-yellow-800 inline">Due to the nature of the music clips, they will likely be much
              longer by default than the graphics clips. Be sure to trim them to a duration of a few seconds. It's
              a good idea to give them about twice the duration of the graphics clips.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Align the start of the intro card with the start of the intro
          music by dragging the clips on the timeline.</li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Align both the intro graphic and music to the beginning of the
          timeline.</li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Align the end of the outro card with the end of the outro music
          by dragging the clips on the timeline.</li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Ensure there is still space between the intro and outro clips.
          <div class="indent-0 mb-2 bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 rounded"><strong
              class="text-yellow-800 font-semibold inline">Note:&nbsp;</strong>
            <p class="text-yellow-800 inline">The exact amount of space isn't important, just that there's enough
              to drop the sermon clip in between.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Navigate to the "Edit" tab.</li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Select both the outro graphic and the outro music. Right click on
          one of them and click "Link clips" in the context menu.</li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Hover over the intro music clip. Two white tabs should appear,
          one in each top corner. <div class="indent-0 mb-2 bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 rounded">
            <strong class="text-yellow-800 font-semibold inline">Note:&nbsp;</strong>
            <p class="text-yellow-800 inline">These tabs designate where audio should end fading in (top left tab)
              or begin fading out (top right tab). This is intuitively displayed by partially fading out the clip,
              mimicking the audio's behavior.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Grab the right tab and drag it left, towards the beginning of the

              class="text-green-800 font-semibold inline">Tip:&nbsp;</strong>
            <p class="text-green-800 inline">Since this tab designates where audio starts fading out, choose a
              spot one or two seconds after the clip starts.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="indent-0 mb-2 bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded"><strong
              class="text-green-800 font-semibold inline">Tip:&nbsp;</strong>
            <p class="text-green-800 inline">Currently, the audio fades out linearly. If you want a more gradual
              or a sharper fade out, use the knob that appears halfway between the tab you dragged and the end of
              the clip.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Repeat steps 12 and 13 for the outro music, mirroring the
          instructions so that the audio fades in, instead of out.</li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">In the "Toolbox" in the lower left corner of the editor, click
          "Video Transitions".</li>
        <li class="pl-4 -indent-4 text-gray-800">Drag and drop "Cross Dissolve" or a transition of your choice
          onto the beginning of the intro graphic clip and the end of the outro clip.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The boilerplate is now complete. Future videos will build off
        of this baseline and are as simple as swapping out the content between the intro and outro clips.</p>
