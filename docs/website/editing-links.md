# Editing Links

Editing links is fairly straightforward in Elementor, the website editor used by ShareFaith. However, there are a few choices to be aware of. First of all, be sure you are signed into the WordPress dashboard and are on the "Pages" screen. If you don't know how to do that, you can find the Website Access guide [here](./website-access.md).

## Internal Links

Internal links are all those on the "victorylutheran.org" domain. They include section links (links to different parts of the same page). Anything else is considered an "external link" and should follow the [external links](#external-links) guidelines below.

1. On the "Pages" screen in the WordPress dashboard, hover over the page you want to edit and click "Edit with Elementor".
   ::: warning Warning
   Be sure to not click "Edit". That will take you to WordPress's default editor, which is not covered in this guide.

2. Once the page loads, find the link (or button) you want to edit.

3. Hover over the link (or button), and click the edit (@pencil-line@) button.

4. In the Inspector, be sure the "Content" tab is selected. Click the database icon (@database@) next to the empty "Link" field to access the site's Dynamic Tags.

5. In the Dynamic Tags menu, select "Internal URL".

6. Click the wrench icon (@wrench@) in the now-filled "Link" field to edit the Internal URL settings.

7. In the type dropdown, choose "Content".

8. To select the link destination, open the "Search & Select" dropdown and start typing the name of the page you want to link to. Then select the page from the list.

## External Links

External links—that is, links not on the victorylutheran.org domain—should be opened in a new tab. The process is very similar to that of internal links.

1. Follow steps 1–3 from the [Internal Links](#internal-links) guide above.

2. In the empty "Link" field, paste or type the full URL to the external page.

3. Click the gear icon (@settings@) next to the "Link" field to access the Link Options.

4. Check the "Open in a new window" box.
