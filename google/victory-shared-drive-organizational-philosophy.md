# Victory Shared Drive Organizational Philosophy

Victory's Shared Google Drive is a fantastic tool for organizing, archiving, and sharing information. However, without proper organizational standards, files can easily get lost. This reference is an attempt to provide some order to the drive structure. It can be summarized into the following rules:

::: info Organizational Philosophy Rules

1. Top-level folders should correspond to single distinct areas of Victory's ministry.
2. Second-level folders should correspond to single distinct subcategories with an area of Victory's ministry.
3. Access to files and folders should be granted at the lowest hierarchical level, with the fewest permissions, and for the shortest amount of time necessary.
4. Folders and files should be marked as archived, rather than deleted.

Keep reading for a more thorough exploration of these rules.

## Top-Level Folders

Top-level folders are those folders immediately accessible upon opening the shared drive. These folders should correspond to a single distinct area of Victory's ministry. For example, some of the existing top-level folders are "Christian Education", "Worship", "Outreach", etc. Folders at this level should be categorized by the broadest possible descriptors, which may or may not include various subcategories. These folders should not sit next to files&mdash;that is, files should not be stored at the top level of the drive.

::: info Rule #1
Top-level folders should correspond to single distinct areas of Victory's ministry.
:::

## Second-Level Folders

Second level folders are those directly inside top-level folders. These folders should correspond to subcategories within the parent top-level folder. For example, second-level folders in the "Worship" top-level folder include "Worship Folders", "Worship Media", "Worship Slides", etc.

::: info Rule #2
Second-level folders should correspond to single distinct subcategories with an area of Victory's ministry.
:::

## Third-Level and Lower Folders

The deeper nested folders are, the more freedom the user has as to the organizational structure of those folders. However, for the benefit of other users, it is recommended to use the same kind of hierarchical granularity when structuring files and folders.

## Sharing Files and Folders with External Users

External users are those users who do not have a '...@victorylutheran.org' email address. Usually, this is because the person is a volunteer. It is not an uncommon scenario that a councilman or event organizer needs to share information from the shared drive with an external user. In such instances, access to files and folders should be granted at the lowest hierarchical level necessary, with the fewest permissions necessary, and for the shortest amount of time necessary.

::: warning Example Scenario
Let's say a volunteer needs to reference the contents of "Report X", a document stored within a folder called "Council Reports". In the event a councilman deems the access necessary, access may be granted according to the following:

1. The volunteer does not need to access multiple reports in the "Council Reports" folder. Thus, the volunteer will be given access to only "Report X", as opposed to the entire "Council Reports" folder.
2. The volunteer does not need to modify any of the data within the report. Thus, the volunteer will be given access as a "Viewer" (a read-only role).
3. The councilman who granted access to the volunteer will check in with the volunteer after a set amount of time to see if access is still required. When it is no longer required, the councilman will revoke access to "Report X".

Access to files and folders should be granted at the lowest hierarchical level, with the fewest permissions, and for the shortest amount of time necessary.

## Archiving Files

In general, if a file or folder is no longer needed, it should be marked as archived, rather than deleted. There are exceptions, of course. For example, files should be deleted when required by copyright or when information could be misleading to future users. In the vast majority of cases, however simply prefixing the files or folders with "&#x2502; Archive:" is sufficient. Determination to delete a file should not be made solely on the basis of the absence of perceived future value.

::: info Rule #4
Folders and files should be marked as archived, rather than deleted.
