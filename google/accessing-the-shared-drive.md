In order to follow the steps in this guide, you will need to be logged in to your '...@victorylutheran.org' email address. If you don't know how to do that, you can follow [this guide](/google/logging-in).

There are two main ways to access Google Drive, and thereby Victory's Shared Drive.

::: info Choose one of the two options:

1.  Access the site directly by visiting [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com).

_or_

1. Access the site from another site on the 'google.com' domain by clicking the "Apps" icon (@grip@) in the upper right corner of the page, then find and click the "Drive" icon.

:::

2. On the Google Drive homepage, click the "Shared drives" option in the sidebar.
   ::: info Note
   It may take a second for the "Shared drives" option to load and appear in the sidebar.
   :::
   ::: warning Warning
   Be sure to click "Shared drives" and not "Shared with me". These options are two distinct sections of Google Drive and represent two completely different kinds of files.

## FAQ

::: details I don't see the "Shared drives" option in the Google Drive sidebar. Where is it?
If the "Shared drives" option does not appear, check to make sure you are logged in with the correct account. If you are not logged in with your '...@victorylutheran.org' email, the option may not appear.

Another possible reason is it may not have loaded yet. As noted above. If you are logged in with your '...@victorylutheran.org' email, the "Shared drives" option may not appear immediately, but should populate within a few seconds.
