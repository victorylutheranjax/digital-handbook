## FAQ

::: details Why is there no "Sign In" button on the Google homepage?
Check to make sure you are not already logged in with a Google account. If you see a profile picture (or initial) where the "Sign In" button should be, you are already logged in. Click the profile picture (or initial) to open the account settings and choose either "Add Account" or "Sign Out", then follow the steps above.
