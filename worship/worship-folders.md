# Worship Folders

## Service Builder

1. Access Christian Worship Service Builder at [builder.christianworship.com](https://builder.christianworship.com).

2. Select the holiday for the service you'd like to plan.

3. In the upper right corner, click "Plan this service".

4. Access Victory's [Worship Planning Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lRl9UOZ33GQtOxvJ7hqQ1CJIQS1_sqIkczst0VnrWlI/edit).

5. In Service Builder, adjust readings; add hymns, psalms, an order of service, and additional rites; and set the usage amount according to the details on the Planning Guide.
   ::: info Note
   For each individual hymn, psalm, and additional rite, you need to click "Add hymn/psalm/rite" and make your selection in the panel on the right side of the screen.
   :::
   ::: info Note
   The most commonly-used modified orders of service can be found near the bottom of the list, in the section entitled "Custom Regular Rotation". Other custom rites and services can also be found near the bottom of the list in relevant sections.
   :::

6. When the details of the service are correct, click "Prepare Bulletin" in the upper right corner.

7. On the bulletin editing screen, under the "Document" tab, select the bulletin format entitled "Victory Default".

8. Work through the document, inputting details from the service plan. Select elements (i.e. "Opening Hymn") to open their respective menus. Then, select the corresponding element from the service plan in the panel on the right side of the screen.
   ::: tip Tip
   This is also a good time to adjust elements of the service according to current custom. This might include things like adding "Hymn Sing Sunday" to the beginning of the service, changing responsive chants to text-only, adjusting captions, removing elements according to certain criteria (e.g. the children's message is removed on communion Sundays), etc.

9. When the worship folder draft is prepared, under the "Document" tab, click "Export" and choose the format in which you wish to download the draft.

## Word Processor

1. Access the <a href="/worship-folders/worship_folder_wrapper_template.docx">Worship Folder Wrapper Template</a>.

2. Access the worship folder draft you downloaded from Service Builder.
   ::: info Note
   If the worship folder draft you downloaded from Service Builder is locked, meaning you are unable to edit it, and, if you are using Microsoft Word as your word processor, you can click "Enable Editing" at the top of the document to unlock it and enable editing.
   :::

3. Copy the text of the worship folder draft and paste it into the appropriate spot in the worship folder wrapper template.
   ::: tip Tip
   As of July 2025, it is recommended to copy the full service, beginning after the initial heading and ending just before the acknowledgements and paste it into the wrapper template after "Our Path for Worship" but before the divider.
   :::

4. Work through the document, inserting any missing details (i.e. special instructions, notes, recognition, reading introductions, etc.), updating template elements from the wrapper, and formatting as desired.
   ::: tip Tip
   Format the document as you'd like it ideally first. You can worry about fitting it to a specific number of pages later.
   :::
   ::: info Note
   Elements such as worship folder cover art, worship series and theme introductions, and reading introductions are all available from [WELS Congregational Services'](https://welscongregationalservices.net/) Foundation.
   :::

5. If printing in a booklet format, adjust formatting as necessary to fit the content to a multiple of four pages.
   ::: info Note
   Fitting to a multiple of four pages usually means condensing or expanding content, but might also mean cutting out or adding content in some cases.
   :::

## Printing and Exporting

1. Once the document is ready to print, go to "File > Print" in your word processor.
   ::: tip Tip
   If you are using a Konica Minolta printer that supports the Universal PCL v4 driver, you can use <a href="/worship-folders/bulletin_regular.ksf" download>this preset</a> to automatically set booklet printing options.
   :::

2. When the settings have been properly entered, click "Print".
   ::: tip Tip
   Be sure to print test copies first. Once the printer has produced a copy you are satisfied with, use the same settings to print the rest.
   :::

3. Export the document as a PDF for file distribution (i.e. to those serving in worship, posted on the church website, etc.) by clicking "File > Export" in your word processor.
   ::: warning Warning
   Not all word processors are created equal when it comes to exporting to PDF. Check that the exported file appears as expected. If it does not, try exporting from a different word processor or using an online tool to convert the document directly into a PDF.

## FAQ

::: details The formatting doesn't look how I want it to in the Service Builder editor. How do I change it?
Service Builder is used for two purposes: generating a ready-made worship folder draft and reporting usage statistics. In reference to the former, there is nothing on the bulletin editing screen that cannot be changed later in a word processor, so don't fret if, for example, something isn't formatted correctly. If you really want to change the look of the bulletin in the editor, you can do so by selecting the gear icon in the upper right corner and clicking "Bulletin Formats" or "Presentation Formats".
:::

::: details Why can't I set custom fonts in Bulletin and Slides formats?
As of July 2025, users are unable to select custom fonts (fonts loaded on their system) for use with bulletin and presentation formats. Instead, users must either choose from a predefined list of fonts or change them to local fonts in a word processor.
